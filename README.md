Breast cancer prediction using Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), SVM and Tkinter GUI(prototype).Complete working model in Jupyter Notebook.

# Breast Cancer Prediction using Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)

This project implements a Machine Learning-based breast cancer diagnosis system
using WOA for feature selection and SVM for classification. A Tkinter-based
desktop prototype is also included for real-time diagnosis.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)
- SVM Classifier
- Tkinter GUI
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
[Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data])


##  Files in This Project

WOA_BreastCancer.ipynb - Notebook for preprocessing, WOA feature selection, and training 
main_tkinter.py - GUI application for real-time prediction 
data.csv - Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset 

##  How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib notebook
2. Run the notebook for WOA:
   jupyter notebook
3. Run Tkinter GUI:
   python main_tkinter.py
